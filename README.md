# bad_strings
I'm collecting some "bad" requests from web logs. The idea is to eventually create an automatic filter and blocker for these requests. I'm currently doing this manually but looking to extend this soon to something more automatic.

# Where are "bad" requests coming from?
They seem to be automated requests coming from bots, malicious software some entity or person created to scan the web for system vulnerabilities.
